The aim of checkpoint 4 was to build in 24 hours, as a conclusion of WildCode School 5 months intensive training a fullstack project leveraging a bit of everything learnt throughout our training, meaning building a fullstack project.

I wanted to build something I had failed to produce several months ago and went on the idea of building a dashboard to follow air quality index and weather forecast on a range of favorite cities. Users can be created and persisted and save their favorite cities for that matter

The technical stack: 
- React / Node / express /mySQL / git
- small database modeling
- API used: waqi.info and openweathermap
- build based on a MVC architecture (and for faster development given the 24 hours limit, i leveraged wildcodeschool react/node template)

API keys and token for APIs are required for the project to work (https://waqi.info and https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) and must be specified in the .env file
